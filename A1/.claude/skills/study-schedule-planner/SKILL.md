# Study Schedule Planner

## Instructions

When creating a study schedule, follow this systematic approach to create an effective and balanced plan.

### 1. Gather Information
- Collect all subjects/topics to study
- Note available study time per day/week
- Identify any deadlines or exam dates
- Determine difficulty level of each subject
- Consider any preferred study times or constraints

### 2. Assess Priority and Difficulty
- High Priority: Subjects with upcoming exams or critical importance
- Medium Priority: Regular subjects with consistent importance
- Low Priority: Subjects that are less urgent or easier
- Assign difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) for each subject

### 3. Calculate Time Distribution
- Total available study time ÷ Number of subjects = Base time per subject
- Adjust based on priority:
  - High Priority: 1.5x base time
  - Medium Priority: 1x base time
  - Low Priority: 0.75x base time
- Consider difficulty - add 25% more time for difficult subjects

### 4. Create Balanced Schedule
- Distribute study sessions throughout the week
- Avoid back-to-back sessions of the same subject
- Include short breaks between sessions (5-10 minutes)
- Schedule difficult subjects during peak focus times
- Mix subjects with different difficulty levels

### 5. Present in Clear Format
- Create a visual schedule (table or calendar format)
- Include session duration and subject
- Add notes on prioritization strategy
- Provide tips for effective studying
- Suggest review sessions and practice time

### 6. Add Flexibility and Review
- Include catch-up time for missed sessions
- Recommend weekly review sessions
- Suggest adjustment strategies if falling behind
- Provide tips for maintaining the schedule

## Examples

| Fri | Biology (2h) | Chemistry (2h) | Math (2h) | Physics (2h) |
| Sat | Mock Exam (3h) | Review Mistakes (3h) | Weak Areas (2h) |
| Sun | Rest & Light Review (4h) | Plan Next Week (1h) | - |

**Priority Strategy:**
- Hard subjects (Chemistry, Physics) get 6 hours each
- Medium subjects (Biology, Math) get 5 hours each
- Weekend focused on testing and weak areas
- Daily review sessions reinforce learning

### Example 3: Part-Time Learner Schedule

**Input:**
- Subjects: Programming, Web Development, Data Structures, Algorithms
- Available time: 10 hours per week (weekends only)
- Working professional, studying for career change
- Priority: Programming (High), Web Dev (High), Data Structures (Medium), Algorithms (Medium)
- Difficulty: Programming (Medium), Web Dev (Easy), Data Structures (Hard), Algorithms (Hard)

**Generated Schedule:**

| Day | Time | Subject | Duration | Notes |
|-----|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Sat | 9:00-11:00 | Programming | 2h | Core skill building |
| Sat | 11:30-13:00 | Web Development | 1.5h | Practical application |
| Sat | 14:00-15:30 | Data Structures | 1.5h | Focus on concepts |
| Sun | 9:00-11:00 | Programming | 2h | Continue core skill |
| Sun | 11:30-13:00 | Algorithms | 1.5h | Problem solving |
